The red channel represents areas that are low in titanium, or high in glass content, the green channel is sensitive to the amount of iron in the surface, and the blue channel reflects the surfaces with high titanium or bright slopes and albedos that are not compensated by using the image ratios.',

These data are taken from the low-altitude portion of the LP mission. A description of the reduction of these data products is given by Lawrence et al. [2002a, 2002b]. The map bin size is 0.5 deg by 0.5 deg.

Data were restricted to local times of 1930 to 0530 with the solar incidence angles greater than 90 degrees, latitudes between 60N and 60S, emission angles less than 15 degrees, brightness temperatures less than 200K. Several data quality constraints were used as well (quality flag for calibration, 0; quality flag for miscellaneous, 0; noise quality flag, 0 to 1).',
