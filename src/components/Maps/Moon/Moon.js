Data is derived from Diviner data collected from July 5, 2009 through September 2, 2012. Data were restricted to local times of 1930 to 0530 with the solar incidence angles greater than 90 degrees, latitudes between 60N and 60S, emission angles less than 15 degrees, brightness temperatures less than 200K. Several data quality constraints were used as well (quality flag for calibration, 0; quality flag for miscellaneous, 0; noise quality flag, 0 to 1).',

This DEM was derived from the original DLR 100 m topographic model, or &quot;GLD100&quot;, and covers 98.2% of the lunar surface and combined with the LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) polar gridded DEM for the areas not covered. Using digital photogrammetric techniques the GLD100 was computed from 69,000 WAC stereo models. Due to persistent shadows near the poles it is not possible to create a complete WAC stereo map at the very highest latitudes.',
